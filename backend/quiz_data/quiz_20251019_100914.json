      "question_text": "Which of the following conditions must be met to multiply two matrices, A and B, where A is of size m x n and B is of size p x q?",
      "options": [
        "m must equal q",
        "n must equal q",
        "m must equal p",
        "n must equal p"

      "correct_answer": "n must equal p",
      "explanation": "For matrix multiplication to be defined, the number of columns in the first matrix (A) must equal the number of rows in the second matrix (B).  Therefore, n must equal p."

      "correct_answer": "2x4",
      "explanation": "When multiplying an m x n matrix by an n x p matrix, the resulting matrix will be m x p.  In this case, 2x3 * 3x4 results in a 2x4 matrix."

      "explanation": "Unlike scalar multiplication, the order of matrices in matrix multiplication matters.  Therefore, it is not commutative."
