        "To expand an expression",
        "To simplify an expression by expressing it as a product of its factors",

      "explanation": "Factoring breaks down an expression into smaller parts (its factors) that, when multiplied together, produce the original expression."

          "correct_answer": "3x",
          "hint": "Look for the largest number and the highest power of x that divides both terms.",
          "explanation": "3 is the largest number that divides both 3 and 12. x is the highest power of x that divides both x^2 and x."

          "hint": "Divide each term in the original expression by the GCF.",
          "explanation": "3x^2 / 3x = x and 12x / 3x = 4, so the factored expression is 3x(x + 4)."
