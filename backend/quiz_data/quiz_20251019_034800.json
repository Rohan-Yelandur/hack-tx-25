    {

          "stage_number": 1,
          "prompt": "Find two numbers that multiply to 6 and add up to 5. What are those numbers?",
          "correct_answer": "2 and 3",
          "hint": "Think about the factors of 6 and which pair sums to 5.",
          "explanation": "The factors of 6 are 1 & 6, and 2 & 3. Only 2 + 3 = 5."
        },

          "stage_number": 2,
          "prompt": "Rewrite the expression using those numbers to create two binomials. What is the factored expression?",
          "correct_answer": "(x + 2)(x + 3)",
          "hint": "The two numbers you found will be the constants in each binomial.",
          "explanation": "Because 2 and 3 add to 5 and multiply to 6, (x + 2)(x + 3) is the factored form."

      "options": [
        "6x",

        "18x\u00b3"
      ],
      "correct_answer": "6x\u00b2",
      "explanation": "The GCF is the largest factor that divides both terms.  6 divides both 12 and 18, and x\u00b2 is the highest power of x that divides both x\u00b3 and x\u00b2."

          "explanation": "The GCF of x\u00b3 and 3x\u00b2 is x\u00b2.  The GCF of 2x and 6 is 2."

          "hint": "Notice the (x+3) is in both remaining terms.",
          "explanation": "(x + 3) is a common factor of both terms, so we factor it out, leaving (x\u00b2 + 2)(x + 3)."
