      "options": [
        "The zero vector.",
        "A scalar multiple of the eigenvector.",
        "A vector orthogonal to the eigenvector.",
        "A vector with the same magnitude as the original vector."
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A scalar multiple of the eigenvector.",
      "explanation": "By definition, multiplying a matrix by its eigenvector results in a scalar (eigenvalue) multiplied by the original eigenvector."

          "correct_answer": "[[-1, 1], [1, -1]]",
          "hint": "Remember to subtract \u03bb from the diagonal elements of A.",
          "explanation": "A - \u03bbI = [[2, 1], [1, 2]] - 3 * [[1, 0], [0, 1]] = [[2-3, 1], [1, 2-3]] = [[-1, 1], [1, -1]]."

          "hint": "The rows of (A - \u03bbI) should be linearly dependent. Focus on one equation.",
          "explanation": "From the matrix equation, we have -x + y = 0 and x - y = 0. Both equations simplify to x = y."

          "stage_number": 3,
          "prompt": "Choose a non-zero value for x (or y, since x=y).  What is a possible eigenvector v?",
          "correct_answer": "[1, 1]",
          "hint": "Any non-zero scalar multiple of a valid eigenvector is also a valid eigenvector.",
          "explanation": "Since x = y, any vector of the form [c, c] where c is a non-zero constant is an eigenvector. [1, 1] is the simplest choice."
