          "prompt": "Find two numbers that multiply to 6 (the constant term) and add up to 5 (the coefficient of the x term). What are these two numbers?",
          "correct_answer": "2 and 3",
          "hint": "Think of factor pairs of 6. Which pair adds up to 5?",
          "explanation": "The numbers 2 and 3 satisfy both conditions: 2 * 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5."

          "hint": "Group the first two terms and the last two terms, and factor out the greatest common factor from each group.",
          "explanation": "From x\u00b2 + 2x + 3x + 6, we get x(x + 2) + 3(x + 2), which factors into (x + 2)(x + 3)."
