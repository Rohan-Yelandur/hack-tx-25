      "question_text": "A Taylor series approximates a function around a specific point, often denoted as 'a'. What does the Taylor series use to achieve this approximation?",
      "options": [
        "The function's values at infinitely many random points.",
        "The function's derivatives evaluated at 'a'.",

      "correct_answer": "The function's derivatives evaluated at 'a'.",
      "explanation": "The Taylor series uses the function's derivatives at the point 'a' to construct a polynomial that approximates the function near that point. Each term in the series is a derivative evaluated at 'a' multiplied by a power of (x-a)."
